**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've started a HR Admin App. Worked on the draft layout of the app. I have the basic wireframes and what the UI should look like. I'll be using PERN (Postgres Express React Node)

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
